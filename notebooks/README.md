# 📓 Project Notebooks  

Welcome to the **notebooks** directory! This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for testing, experimenting, and refining our approach to diffusion models and DreamBooth fine-tuning.  

---

## 📌 Notebook Overview  

### 🖼️ **1. diffusion_text-img.ipynb**  
> **Goal:** Explore training and inference of text-to-image diffusion models using textual prompts.  

🔹 Understand how diffusion models generate images from text.  
🔹 Experiment with different prompts to analyze their effect on output.  
🔹 Gain insights into diffusion-based generative AI techniques.  

---

### 🚀 **2. POC_DreamBooth.ipynb**  
> **Goal:** Test the DreamBooth fine-tuning approach and establish a strong starting point for model training.  

🔹 Implement initial fine-tuning on custom subject images.  
🔹 Evaluate results and identify key parameters for improvement.  
🔹 Establish a working baseline for further optimizations.
